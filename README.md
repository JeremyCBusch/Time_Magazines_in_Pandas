# Time_Magazines_in_Pandas

# Overview
This was my first attempt at data analysis. My goal was to learn and become familiar with using large datasets and creating tables and graphs to make sense of them.

I found a data set from Kaggle with every Time Magazine cover, who was on the cover, and what their occupation is. I wanted to answersquestions on what type of occupations are more likely to be on a cover of Time, and if this differs from differnt decades.

Data analysis interests me because I like learning from direct sources when i can. I think a lot of people get information from someone else, as opposed to finding it out themselves. Through data anlysis I can teach myself how to find answers to my questions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

* What is the most likely occupation to be on a cover of Time Magazine
* Does the most likely occpation change through different decades

# Development Environment

visual studio
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib

# Future Work

* Create a line graph with all the different occupations and how they have changed every year
* Find the highest covers in one year for each occupation and return the year and the amound of covers 
* Learn more about the different configurations that can be made to graphs to make the information more clear
